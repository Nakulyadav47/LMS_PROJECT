Library-Management-System
## Overview
This Library Management System is a Java-based console application that allows users to manage book borrowing and returning efficiently. The system keeps track of book availability, borrower details, and due dates while also calculating fines for late returns.

## Features
- üìö Add Books to Library: Initializes with 50 books, each with a unique ID, title, and author.
- üë§ Borrow a Book: Users can borrow a book by providing their name and the number of days they intend to keep it.
- ‚úÖ Return a Book: Users can return a borrowed book, and the system will check if any late fine is applicable.
- üìã Check Borrowed Books Status: Displays currently borrowed books with borrower details and return deadlines.
- üîç View All Books: Lists all books with their availability status.
- ‚öñ Fine Calculation: If a book is returned late, a fine of ‚Çπ10 per extra day is applied.

## Technologies Used
- Java for core programming.
- Java Collections (HashMap) for efficient book storage and lookup.
- Java Time API (LocalDate, ChronoUnit) for date calculations.
- Scanner (User Input Handling) for interactive console-based operations.
